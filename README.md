RMarkdown tutorial
==================

This repository contains the material for the R-Ladies Barcelona introduction tutorial about RMarkdown.

The slides .Rmd is [here](rmd_tutorial.Rmd), the html rendered version is [here](rmd_tutorial.html). The slides are also alvailable via [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/masalmon/rladiesbcn_rmarkdown). Most of the tutorial will be live coding though so the slides are not too useful on their own.

We will learn RMarkdown by creating a report together where we'll test some options and possibilities, like the report [here](report_example/test_report.Rmd).

If we have time we will look at another output format based on the same principles, see the slides [here](slides_example/test_slides.Rmd).

# Further resources

* The [RStudio RMarkdown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with useful articles, a gallery, etc.

* For some resources more tailored at using RMarkdown in academia, see [this repo](https://github.com/masalmon/rmd_course_isglobal)

* For working directory pain we quickly mentioned the awesome [`ezknitr` package](https://github.com/ropensci/ezknitr) for choosing where the output of your RMarkdown file should be.

* For tables an attendee said the [`stargazer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/index.html) package is great.

* I remember a question about `Pandoc` I couldn't quite answer... For more info "behind the knit button", [Yihui Xie's slides from the RStudio conference](https://slides.yihui.name/2017-rstudio-conf-rmarkdown-Yihui-Xie.html#1) are great. There should soon be a video recording as well.
